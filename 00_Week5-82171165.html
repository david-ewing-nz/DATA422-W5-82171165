<td style="text-align: left;">Prompt delivery and a very polite and courteous delivery guy. However, I'd like to ask that you stop giving discount codes in percentages. Like just say it's x amount off on orders above y amount, instead of z% (upto x amount) on orders above y. It's more honest and less aggravating to people who actually expected a z% discount on any amount they were willing to spend over the limit.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">The first 2 times were great. Third time the reorder tab wasn‚Äôt there. I put in the address I wanted it delivered to and continued, but when I finished order it had reverted to my present address! Fortunately I found the undo in time. I went to a different app to order. I would like to see if there is a monthly subscription to eliminate delivery fees, like at Walmart. I order food for my 97 year old Dad. Was considering getting him a smart phone, set it up for just hitting reorder, but this was discouraging.</td>

The person who was the meal intended to, never heard door bell and no food was left at the front door. Whatever happened to it noone knows. I hope whoever took it enjoyed it.</td>

Who only deliver the food they do not pack it. Trying to contact Uber Eats is virtually impossible. Unable to speak to anyone just leave a complaint and they state they will respond EVENTUALLY. Meanwhile you just have to starve and be out of pocket</td>

However this was a total headache to find. will edit my review upwards if it does pan out. BAD driver but I might give UE the benefit of the doubt.</td>

Would give 0 stars if possible as this is the worst app I have ever used, I have ordered from it three times, twice food has not been delivered while money has been taken from my bank and not refunded, and once food was arrived it was the wrong order aswell as being cold. Without refund, there is no contact number for when these problems occur. I am owed nearly ¬£50 worth of food!!!!!! Please use Justeat or deliveroo instead as they atleast give you a refund or vouchers for your next orders.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Uber Eats has become frustratingly fraudulent. If a rider delivers the wrong item, or damages your package; you are forced to pay either way. It has happened to me several times, I tried to claim a refund but didn‚Äôt get any. They lie about their refunds. And the customer service is basically useless as you'll never get a response or solution. Had to delete the app altogether</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Won't be ordering from them anymore. The app picked the wrong address, the driver (not his fault) called us a couple of times but due to broken English it took us time to understand what the problem was. When we realised he was in the wrong location it was too late to fix it up, we couldn't get there because we don't have a car, and he wouldn't come to the right address. I wanted to cancel the order and get it back to the restaurant and re delivered by someone else but it wasn't possible. No food (not sure where it ended up), no refund, no clear explanation other than: "this is not elegible for a refund because the driver tried to contact you and waited".</td>

I have been told on Twitter I am not eligible for a refund, currently trying to get one through live chat they have given me 6-12 hours to expect a response. Avoid using this service as if something goes wrong it is incredibly difficult to get your money back!!!!</td>

I called McDonalds and they told me to call UberEATS. I called them and they basically told me that someone would contact me within 24 hours. I asked to speak to the manager (Fahem Iqbac) and asked what I would do for lunch, but he just kept repeating "I hope you have a better experience next time". I then asked how they would contact me, but got told they wouldn't, they will contact the account holder. I said it's my order and my money, why can't you contact me personally but he refused even though I wouldn't see the daughter again. I wish I had never placed an order with them and will never use them again. If anything goes wrong, you go without food.</td>

What pisses me off is that they are reaping people off right in my face. I cancelled the order in less than a minute and they held me up on phone for 30 minutes or more trying to explain to me the reason why they won't refund. They already practiced their reasons and what to say. I pressed the wrong button and immediately cancelled.

Ordered my food, after waiting for an hour, driver marked it as delivered and what a surprise, the driver and delivery both did not arrive. When contacted the support, they indeed refunded my money but never listened to my concerns and dissatisfactions. Their customer service is absolute zero.Providing refund is not only the solution. Of course, if my food did not arrive, you have to refund me. What about the whole time I wasted to wait for my order? Where is the driver, why not investigate? Why the order was marked as delivered when the driver itself was not at the location? It's a scam.Please train your employees as well as the drivers to do their job properly.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Don‚Äôt like how they price things. I did a comparison where I made orders through them and then made orders directly at the establishment. And compared prices I‚Äôll give you an example. A burger, large fries, large drink, and chicken tenders, at the place it‚Äôs 17 bucks. Through Uber eats total was 65. And this was only with a 10 dollar tip. That‚Äôs round about 35 dollars in fees. (Not exact). Then when I checked and compared prices the places they do business with price the items higher on Uber eats. With 65 bucks I could go to an all you can eat fancy steak house and eat well instead of eating unhealthy foods. Most delivery companies tend to do the same thing. Offer crazy high prices for things that cost much less than they normally are. This is what makes giving a higher tip impossible. The more you empty my wallet the less I can provide to the driver directly. Now it appears though that Uber has somewhat made some improvements and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not giving a flat out 1 star. What I mean is that I no longer have issues with their systems. And no longer have issues with their drivers where previously I had plenty of issues with both. I just wish these companies would stick to flat rates instead of variable prices. Where they feel to the need to hike up fees for whatever internal reason they might have. If only Uber wasn‚Äôt insanely expensive they would earn more stars unfortunately due to high prices it‚Äôs a 2 star from me.</td>

Not only was the food stone cold on delivery, but a chicken burger was missing. My wife called to complain as she is the calm one. She was told the delivery was in good time. She relayed the change of driver to the customer service (I use the term loosely) operator and said the burger was missing and the food is stone cold and asked for a refund. This was refused except for the missing chicken burger. The operator was clearly reading from a script and my wife pointed this out. "thank you for your feedback"? We hadn't given any!. It concluded with the operator saying we are going round in circles and I am giving you your first warning, then hung up. We actually got a warning for daring to complain.

<td style="text-align: left;">My cousin and his wife in South Africa had a break-in and had their home ransacked and goods including kitchenware stolen. To help, given that I am in London and cannot drive over to help clean up or bring food, I bought a ¬£100 gift card to send to my cousin. UberEATS provided no disclosure to note that the gift card is only redeemable in the UK. When I reached out to UberEATS for a refund, the support person refused citing policy. UberEATS policy does not take precedence over UK law. A material omission of the kind contemplated by the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, renders the transaction voidable. Accordingly, I request and expect a refund.EDIT:UberEATS has closed 2 tickets in its bid to avoid paying the refund. The first support person didn't even bother to ask any questions, cited policy, and closed the ticket. The second support person sent me on a wild goose chase for information that he already had in a part of the app where the information does not reside, then closed the ticket merely because another ticket existed. The second person did not even bother to check that the other ticket was closed before closing the existing ticket. The tactics appear designed to stonewall and frustrate. Keep going, Uber; it'll make the formal complaint to Trading Standards that much better.</td>

I spoke to one of their representatives named ‚Äúwolf‚Äù who informed me that, since 48 hours had passed, they could no longer make the adjustment [refund]. He then kept repeating the same statement to my inquiries and ended the chat without resolution. At that point, I decided to go with a different delivery service for my food deliveries, going forward.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">was craving a burrito and was looking to try a new location. So, I decided to stop on in and give Cielo in Schaumburg, a try. The service was awesome as for the initial meet and greet for a customer. I decided to order an El Pastor Burrito to take home and enjoy while relaxing and watching some tv. The complete time spent waiting for the food was about 10 minutes or so. When I got home, I got comfortable and prepared everything around me so that I can eat with no interruptions. I opened up the bag and grabbed the wrapped in foil burrito. My hand felt super moist, so I was thinking that this burrito is going to be very juicy. But when I looked at my hand it was dripping in the oil used to cook the meat. The burrito shell was covered in oil, but I was like ok I'm going to still give this a try. I opened the super oily foil wrapped around the burrito and 1st thing that I noticed was that the El Pastor was burnt through and through and tasted very pasty (OLD). The burrito was cut in half and filled, actually super stuffed with El Pastor which is awesome but even the El Pastor in the 2nd half was burnt through and through, (Black &amp; Crispy). That was a 12-to-13-dollar loss, and I ended up eating pizza after throwing the entire burnt burrito out in the trash. I did notice the sign on the front window stating looking for a cook, and I guess that I should have read between the lines there. Actually, the worst burrito I have ever had. Check your bag before taking out!!</td>
